# SimData

#Our project is divided to 4 main parts.

#Part 1 :<br>
<b>Pandas drawings<br>

  In this part we had to analyze different simplistic drawings with information on how they were drawn.
  We used algorithms we ourselves made in order to understand the drawings in a deeper way in order to
  count lines, check if the drawings have closed or open shapes and how many times the person who drew the picture took his hand off the drawing.<b>
  
#Part 2 : <br>
<b>Cats vs Dogs Dataset<br>

In this part we had to analyze a dataset that consisted of pictures of cats and dogs and we had to built a python program that differentiated between the two with a high success rate.
In the end we used sophisticated algorithms such as XGBoost,Adaboost,SVC,KNN and Hard Voting.
   
#Part 3 :<br>
<b>Fashion-MNIST Dataset<br>
![plot](https://github.com/TamirIsCool/SimData/blob/main/readmepic/fashions.png)
In this part we had to analyze a dataset that consisted of pictures many pictures of clothing items and we had to build a python program that differentiated between many types of clothing items with a high success rate.
We reached a success rate of 89.8% (Almost 90%!)
We used many types of sophisticated algorithms such as Logistic regression, Random Forest, SVC, KNN and Hardvoting.
 
#Part 4 :<br>
<b>Upgraded old Wine dataset<br>
![plot](https://github.com/TamirIsCool/SimData/blob/main/readmepic/wines.png)
As part of this semester's project we had to make our old project better using new algorithms we learned, moreover we added more analytical tools such as PCA and TSNE.
We reached better solutions with our new algorithms and we got to showcase the power of PCA even though it got lower results.
